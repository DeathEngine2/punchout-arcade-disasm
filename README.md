# Punch-Out Disassembly
This is a work-in-progress commented disassembly of the 1984 Nintendo arcade game Punch-Out.
Keep in mind this project is nowhere near complete as of now, all I have so far is the game's Z80 code, disassembled using the MAME debugger.

## To-Do list:
- Document all of the Z80 code
- Disassemble and document the sound code, which runs on a Ricoh 2A03
- Split everything into separate ASM files once completed
- Much, much more

## Special thanks to:
- The MAME team, for their work on documenting the Punch-Out hardware, and for their very useful debugger.
- Nintendo, for creating the original Punch-Out arcade game.
- Every website that had documentation on the Zilog Z80 available for me to use
