sound CPU:
the sound CPU is a 2A03, which is a modified 6502 with built-in input ports
and two (analog?) outputs. The input ports are memory mapped at 4016-4017;
the outputs are more complicated. The only thing I have found is that 4011
goes straight into a DAC and produces the crowd sounds, but several addresses
in the range 4000-4017 are written to. There are probably three tone generators.
